# google-homepage

Attempted to create a visual replica of the google homepage.
First time attempting to use HTML and CSS, so I am painfully unaware of any adopted common practices. 
Have a shallow understanding now of how display/positioning works in CSS, and I have lots more to learn. Simply understanding how to center things was a challenge to me.

Hopefully I can look back and cringe one day.
